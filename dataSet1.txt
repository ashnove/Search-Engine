A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.

For example, finding the sum of all the elements in an array from index left to right, or finding the minimum of all the elements in an array from index left to right. These problems can be easily solved with one of the most powerful data structures, Segment Tree ( in-short Segtree ).
